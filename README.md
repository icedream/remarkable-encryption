# Remarkable 2 Encryption

This repository contains multiple tools to encrypt the home folder of the
reMarkable 2 epaper tablet using
[`gocryptfs`](https://github.com/rfjakob/gocryptfs). Detailed background
information can be found in the accompanying [blog
post](https://blog.redteam-pentesting.de/2021/remarkable-encryption/).

# Disclaimer

This project is considered experimental and it cannot be guaranteed that the
device will not be bricked as a result of this setup. The project and the
toolchain in this repository were tested on the reMarkable 2 firmware version
`2.13.0.689`. If a different firmware version is used, the commit hash
(`FRAMEBUFFER_COMMIT`) in the `Makefile` has to be updated to a
[remarkable2-framebuffer](https://github.com/ddvk/remarkable2-framebuffer)
commit that supports the chosen firmware version. Otherwise, the toolchain
likely produces a crashing passphrase prompt application. In this case, the
device can be unlocked by providing the passphrase via USB network connection:

```bash
# the actual IP addres may differ
echo 'yourpassphrase' | nc 10.11.99.1 1234
```

# Build

This project is meant to be build using the [toltec v2.x
toolchain](https://github.com/toltec-dev/toolchain/tree/v2.x). However, as this
project contains Qt and Go builds, no single `toltec` Docker image can compile
the whole project. Instead, this project contains a `Dockerfile` which is based
on the `toltec` Qt `Dockerfile` and adds Go 1.16, `git` and `wget`.

```bash
docker build -t remarkable-crypto-toolchain .
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/project remarkable-crypto-toolchain make
```

Alternatively, the components of this project can be built separately with the
official `toltec` Docker images and the corresponding `Makefile` targets
(`dist_go` with the `golang` image, `dist_qt` with the `qt` image and
`dist_rest` in any environment with `wget`, `ar`, `tar` and `sha256sum`
installed).

# Deployment

After building the project, the directory structure has to be created on the
reMarkable 2:

```bash
# on reMarkable 2
mkdir -p /home/crypto/bin /home/crypto/fs /home/crypto/lib
```

The contents of the `dist` folder are replicated on the reMarkable:

```bash
# on build system
scp dist/home/crypto/bin/* remarkable:/home/crypto/bin/
scp dist/home/crypto/lib/* remarkable:/home/crypto/lib/
scp dist/etc/systemd/system/cryptodaemon.service remarkable:/etc/systemd/system/
scp dist/etc/systemd/system/framebufferserver.service remarkable:/etc/systemd/system/
```

The setup can then be completed on the reMarkable:

```bash
# on reMarkable 2
chmod u+x /home/crypto/bin/*
PATH=/home/crypto/bin gocryptfs -init /home/crypto/fs
systemctl daemon-reload

# Stop the running xochitl (on plaintext home directory).
systemctl stop xochitl

# After this step the screen will become blank
systemctl enable framebufferserver --now

# Enable and start setup of the encrypted filesystem.
# Enter a password, afterwards the screen will be blank again.
# WARNING: At this point all unencrypted data has been wiped,
# device setup starts again and A NEW SSH PASSPHRASE IS SET.
systemctl enable cryptodaemon --now

# Start xochitl on now encrypted filesystem.
systemctl start xochitl
```
